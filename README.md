The Shan He University (SHU) is a public virtual comprehensive university in China.
After the [Gaokao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaokao) in 2023, students from four densely populated provinces (Henan, Hebei, Shandong and Shanxi) decide to create SHU to providing high quality education to local people.
The location of SHU is aimed at the border of those four provinces. 
Thus, students can stay close to their hometown.
